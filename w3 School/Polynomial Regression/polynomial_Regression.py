        ----------------------------------Polynomial Regression---------------------------------------
        
        
        If your data points clearly will not fit a linear regression (a straight line through all data 
        points), it might be ideal for polynomial regression.
        
        
        Polynomial regression, like linear regression, uses the relationship between the variables x 
        and y to find the best way to draw a line through the data points.
